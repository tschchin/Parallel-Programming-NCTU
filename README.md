# Programming Assignment I: Pthreads Programming
Toss Darts to estimate Pi.  
- Equation: number in circle/total number of tosses = pi/4  
- Key Point: Use **thread safety** function.  

# Programming Assignment II: OpenMP Programming
Conjugate gradient method is an algorithm for the numerical solution of particular systems of linear equations. It is often used to solve partial differential equations, or applied on some optimization problems.
In this assignment, we are asked to parallelize a serial implementation of the conjugate gradient method using OpenMP. (0756551.c)
- Key Point: Find the function which could Parall Compute and add openMP pragma (private, reduction ...).
 

# Programming Assignment III: MPI Programming
Use MPI to parallelize the given serial program.
- Distributed System

# Programming Assignment IV:CUDA Programming
Use CUDA to parallelize concurrent wave equation.

# Programming Assignment VI:OpenCL Programming
Use OpenCL to parallelize the implementation of the image histogram.
